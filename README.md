Hello to Corepunk Crafting Assistant 
This is a tool design to help people visualize the recipes while you have you bank open so you dont have to take screenshots or memorize the items needed for the recipe. 

To use the program you just need to click on the CorepunkAssistant.exe 

At the moment the recipes included in v1.0.0 are: Artifacts, Weapons and Chips.
